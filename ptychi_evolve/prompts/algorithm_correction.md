# Algorithm Correction

The following regularization algorithm encountered an error:

```python
{code}
```

Error Message: {error}

Common issues:

- Tensor dimension mismatches (use .unsqueeze()/.squeeze())
- Coordinate grid size errors: When creating grids, use the FULL dimensions:
  ```python
  n_slices, H, W = self.data.shape
  yy = torch.linspace(-1, 1, steps=H, device=device)  # NOT H-1!
  xx = torch.linspace(-1, 1, steps=W, device=device)  # NOT W-1!
  ```
  Error "The size of tensor a (X) must match the size of tensor b (X-1)" usually means using H-1 instead of H
- Device compatibility (ensure all tensors on same device using tensor.to(self.data.device))
- In-place operations on leaf tensors (use .clone())
- Missing imports or undefined functions

Return a Python function with the following signature:

```python
def regularize_llm(self):
    """Your regularization algorithm."""
    # self.data is a torch.Tensor of complex values with shape [n_slices, height, width]
    # Apply regularization in-place, do not change data shape
    # Ensure all created tensors are on the same device as self.data
    # Call self.set_data(data) at the end
```
