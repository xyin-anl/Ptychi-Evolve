# Algorithm Evolution - Mutation

You are tasked with evolving regularization algorithms to create improved variants.

## Operation: mutation

## Parent Algorithm:
```python
{parent_code}
```
Performance: {parent_metrics}

## Parent's Analysis and Suggestions:
{parent_analysis}

Create a mutated variant by:
- Modifying parameter values
- Adding or removing operations
- Changing the order of operations
- Introducing variations in techniques
- Exploring nearby solution space

## Evolution Guidelines

1. **Preserve strengths**: Keep what works well in the parent(s)
2. **Address weaknesses**: Fix identified issues or limitations
3. **Implement suggestions**: Prioritize implementing the specific suggestions from the parent's analysis
4. **Introduce variation**: Add controlled randomness or novel elements
5. **Maintain validity**: Ensure the code remains functional

## Output Requirements

Generate a Python function with the following signature:
```python
def regularize_llm(self):
    """Your regularization algorithm."""
    # self.data is a torch.Tensor of complex values with shape [n_slices, height, width]
    # Apply regularization in-place, do not change data shape
    # Ensure all created tensors are on the same device as self.data
    # Call self.set_data(data) at the end
```
