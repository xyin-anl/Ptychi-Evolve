# Algorithm Evolution - Crossover

You are tasked with evolving regularization algorithms to create improved variants.

## Operation: crossover

## Parent Algorithms

### Parent 1:

```python
{parent1_code}
```

Performance: {parent1_metrics}
Analysis: {parent1_analysis}

### Parent 2:

```python
{parent2_code}
```

Performance: {parent2_metrics}
Analysis: {parent2_analysis}

Create an offspring that combines the best aspects of both parents. Consider:

- Mixing their regularization techniques
- Blending parameter values
- Combining complementary operations
- Creating hybrid approaches

## Evolution Guidelines

1. **Preserve strengths**: Keep what works well in the parent(s)
2. **Address weaknesses**: Fix identified issues or limitations
3. **Merge suggestions**: Consider implementing suggestions from both parents' analyses, especially complementary ones
4. **Introduce variation**: Add controlled randomness or novel elements
5. **Maintain validity**: Ensure the code remains functional

## Output Requirements

Generate a Python function with the following signature:

```python
def regularize_llm(self):
    """Your regularization algorithm."""
    # self.data is a torch.Tensor of complex values with shape [n_slices, height, width]
    # Apply regularization in-place, do not change data shape
    # Ensure all created tensors are on the same device as self.data
    # Call self.set_data(data) at the end
```
